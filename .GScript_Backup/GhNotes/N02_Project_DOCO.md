## Overivew
Assignments and daily notes including links to the most important doc. and data.
The purpose is to integrate the notes with my local notes that I can complie any
time with **pandoc**

## Tools and requirements
Using the following

- Pandoc which can complie my current document into a pdf file
- NVIM editor which I am using recently for flexibility and editing faster.
  - Using the formula

```
./script.sh &&  pandoc -f markdown N01_Note_Meeting.md -o N01_Note_Meeting.pdf && open N01_Note_Meeting.md

```
  - Notes that I am using a script that I wrote in bash to turn-of and turn-off a script.
