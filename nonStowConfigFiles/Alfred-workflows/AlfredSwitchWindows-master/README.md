# Swift Windows Switcher

## Catalina Users

Make sure that Alfred is added to "Security & Privacy -> Screen Recording".
The context on why that is needed is [here](https://github.com/mandrigin/AlfredSwitchWindows/issues/31).

My little "weekend" project.
Alfred workflow to switch between open windows in the system and Safari tabs.

![](/demo_concise.gif)

## Features
- Switch between the open windows using Alfred
- Switch between the Safari tabs using Alfred
- Very quick comparing to the alternative implementations because of the native search implementation.

## Releases

You can download the ready-to-use `.workflow` files from [the releases page](https://github.com/mandrigin/AlfredSwitchWindows/releases).

## Source code

You can start exploring the source code at [main.swift](EnumWindows/main.swift)

### `ScriptingBridge` in Swift

It turns out, that `ScriptingBridge` implementation is not fully compatible with Swift.

(Classes like `SafariApplication` are not imported, so we can't use them).

One of the possible solutions to this issue is demonstrated in [BrowserApplication.swift](EnumWindows/BrowserApplication.swift)
(used for both Safari and Chrome automation)

**UPD:** There is a better solution using `optional` protocol methods:
```swift
@objc fileprivate enum PlayerState: NSInteger {
    case stopped = 0x6b505353
    case playing = 0x6b505350
    case paused = 0x6b505370
    case fastForwarding = 0x6b505346
    case rewinding = 0x6b505352
};

@objc fileprivate protocol iTunesBridge {
    @objc optional var isRunning: Bool { get }
    @objc optional var playerState: PlayerState { get }
    @objc optional func pause() -> Void
}

extension SBApplication: iTunesBridge{}

guard let app = SBApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.iTunes") as? iTunesBridge else {
   return
}

let isPlaying = app.playerState == .playing

NSLog("isPlaying: \(isPlaying)")
```
